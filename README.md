# SEIR_simulation
We developed an extended SEIR model using epidemiological and hospital admission data. A time-varying transmission rate was estimated, and the epidemic in Wuhan was reconstructed.Here, our procedure is divided into two parts. The first part is used to estimate the transmission rate, and the second part is used to simulate the situation of the epidemic situation when the hospital construction plan is changed.Refer to the paper for more details on the model
